       MICROSOFT FOUNDATION CLASS LIBRARY : t2s
========================================================================

 This is a text to speech program that reads out loud the clipboard. Simply select a text in any applicayion and copy it to the clipboard.

  It  was developed on MSVC 6.00 and recompiled on VS 2015.

 The setup in the install directory is the original MSVC 6 version, the executables in the Debug and Release directories are the new MSVC 2015 compited versions. (should meke no difference)

 This program should work on all versions of windows, as the MFC libraries are included in all of them.
